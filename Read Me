Hello this is Github Repository is a assemblage of tools to help combine 
Word docs and PDFs together to make them easier to upload and share.

Moreover it can convert Word Docs to Electronic Friendly PDFs. Though their a permission errors.

This project has been tested on a Mac, not sure how well it works on Windows computers.
